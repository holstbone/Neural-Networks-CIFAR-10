# Neural-Networks-CIFAR-10

This paper addresses how the Convolutional Neural Network (Convnet) concept provides
exceptional performance in computer vision multi-class classification models over Deep Neural
Networks. In our experiments we were able to achieve 80.6% Test Accuracy with convolutional
neural network techniques. Building and deploying predictive models using convolutional neural
networks, which benefits today’s image-based industries -- everything from facial recognition, to
scene interpretation, to self-driving cars -- has experienced dramatic improvements thanks to
concepts introduced in the 2010’s by University of Toronto researchers who developed the
CIFAR-10 dataset. Opportunities for advancement to deploy predictive models using
convolutional neural network multi-layer perceptrons is now a reality and benefitting millions of
people every single day.
